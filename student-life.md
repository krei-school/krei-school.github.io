    title: Adoption Program
    text: "The adoption programme is the most prestigious programme which we implement
      within our schools. As the name signifies every teacher ‘adopts’ around 15-20
      students and assumes complete responsibility in taking care of students in academic
      and behavioural matters. These adoption gurus regularly make calls on a fortnightly
      basis to parents to receive feedback.  \n\nIn the area of academics, individually
      tailored learning plans are prepared and implemented by the guru in coordination
      with the subject teacher and the parent. The progress is tracked daily and communicated
      to the parent. The guru also identifies the unique specific talents be it in
      sports, spelling bee, dance, painting etc. in a child. The guru in coordination
      with the parent also constructively counsels the student on any behavioural
      issues that the child may be facing. Thus the trio of guru, parent and subject
      teacher act as a supportive structure to the student."

        title: Motherly Care
        text: The teachers in the primary classes are specially trained to be sensitive
          to the individual needs of the young minds from nursery to 2nd class. Teachers
          take extra care, and that is why they are aptly called ‘ Mother teachers’.

        title: Innovative Learning
        text: Various approaches and strategies are used by teachers in our schools
          so that learning is not just confined to the one way ‘ teacher teaching-
          student listening’ approach. These include using real-life examples so that
          the concepts are clearly understood, practical approach to learning, using
          ICT tools in the delivery of teaching, conducting field trips related to
          subject learning, encouraging students to participate in science fairs and
          other competitions like Olympiads, intergroup competitions within the class
          and also across the campuses, group discussions and debates on issues etc.
          All these help the students in embracing a learning approach which is innovative,
          voluntary and fun.

        title: Interactive Classes
        text: Interactive classes are conducted on the campuses, unlike other schools.
          A healthy learning environment is cultivated right from day one in which
          the children are not afraid or feel inconvenienced at speaking up in the
          classrooms out of hesitation or fear of ridicule. This approach helps in
          clearing any doubts that the child may be having then and there itself apart
          from developing self-confidence and self-esteem in them.

    title: Sports
    text: "We strongly believe that student life within the campus should not be confined
      to just the classrooms. Sports and Games bring many physical benefits to the
      child. Apart from that, they also help in developing the qualities of team spirit,
      leadership, respect for authority, mental alertness and boosts self-confidence.\n\nOur
      spacious campuses and sports infrastructure within it provide ample opportunities
      for students to excel in various sports. The school carefully nurtures any unique
      talents that the child has, and they are encouraged to play in zonal/district/state
      and national level sports competitions. Our schools have a good track record
      of winning several district/ state and national level sports competitions over
      the years.  "

    title: Yoga and Meditation
    text: |-
      Yoga and meditation have been closely correlated with the physical, mental and spiritual development of an individual. That is why we have included both these in our daily campus routines. Every day in the morning, there is a short 10-minute meditation session done by all the children and staff in the classroom.

       Yoga classes are conducted twice per week for day scholars and daily in the morning for residential students. Apart from this, we also do summer yoga camps every year at the Bachupally campus.

    text: 'The benefits of extracurricular activities are many. Engaging in sports,
      drama, painting, music, singing, dancing, debates etc. apart from providing
      a productive break from study, they also help students to explore their interests
      and help develop broader mental perspective, improve self-esteem, improve social
      skills and networks, teach life skills outside the classroom. They also look
      good on your admission applications to universities and resumes. '

        title: Career Counselling
        text: It's often the case that as we grow up what jobs /careers we are in
          and what we are good at are not the same, which leads to frustration and
          disenchantment. We believe that choosing a career path should be determined
          by one's aptitude and interests rather than what careers are ticking in
          the industry. Those who are fortunate in aligning their interests and vocations
          have a deep sense of fulfilment and satisfaction in life. That's why every
          year we conduct career counselling workshops to the outgoing 10th class
          students in tie-up with an NGO called Nirmaan Organisation.  Wherein the
          aptitudes and interests of students are explored and assessed, and we suggest
          various career paths that are aligned.
