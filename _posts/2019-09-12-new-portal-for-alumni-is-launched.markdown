We are proud to say that the Keshava Reddy Schools since inception have given quality education to nearly one lakh students. The foundation provided at school has helped many students to secure themselves a place in top colleges/universities in India and abroad. Most of our previous students are performing exceptionally well in their respective fields.

Keshava Reddy Schools Alumni Association is a forum for all ex-students to reconnect and build strong networks to strengthen their careers and social capital. You could use the network to arrange for a get-together and re-live school memories with help from the school management. The association also involves helping the current students in career counselling and guidance. It also supports the student and staff community in their hours of need. Alumni network will also be taking up social activities in the fields of education, health, agriculture, environment, disaster relief in partnership with other like-minded NGOs.

Our network consists of many successful Entrepreneurs, software engineers, doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants, civil servants, bankers, athletes, social workers, teachers, political leaders etc.
