        text: "“Excellence through Education” Excellence means perfection. Doing a
          thing in a perfect manner gains the attention as well as the commendation
          of the world. Bright future awaits a person who attains perfection in his
          field, but perfection cannot be accomplished in a day or two. Constant practice
          is needed for it. As the proverb goes “Practice makes man perfect”, ample
          opportunities should be provided to the child for acquiring varied knowledge
          of things on his own. "
