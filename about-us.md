    title: History
    text: "Keshava Reddy Schools have been established with the vision of giving stress-free
      quality education. The schools have its beginning in Nandyal where the first
      campus was started in 1993 with 190 students in rented premises. To achieve
      a bigger vision, we started investing our efforts, time, energy and money into
      building spacious, green and own campuses spread across over 100s of acres.
      \n\nFrom a humble start, we have grown continuously over the years, from Nandyal
      to Kurnool, Tirupathi, Anantapur, Hyderabad, Mahabubnagar, Proddatur, Chittor,
      Kadapa, Madanapalle, Rajahmundry, Srikakulam, Guntur, and Vikarabad. Right now
      our schools have 32 branches spread across ten districts in both the Telugu
      states. Over 52000 students have passed out from our schools since inception.
      Right now, the student strength in our campuses is 26500. Over 2000 trained
      faculty ensures that there a healthy and desired teacher-pupil ratio."
