    text: |-
      Keshava Reddy Schools have been established with the vision of giving stress-free quality education. The schools have its beginning in Nandyal where the first campus was started in 1993 with 190 students in rented premises. Having a bigger vision to provide quality infrastructure, schools were shifted into spacious, green and own premises.

      From such a humble start, we have grown continuously over the years, from Nandyal to Kurnool, Tirupathi, Anantapur, Hyderabad, Mahabubnagar, Proddatur, Chittor, Kadapa, Madanapalle, Rajahmundry, Srikakulam, Guntur, and Vikarabad. Right now our schools have 32 branches spread across ten districts in both the Telugu states. Over 52000 students have passed out from our schools since inception. Right now, the student strength in our campuses is 26500. Over 2000 trained faculty ensures that there a healthy and desired teacher-pupil ratio.

    text: "Our educational institutions, since inception, have become a pioneer in
      giving stress-free quality education. Every student is given adequate attention
      and care in our spacious and green campuses. The top results achieved by our
      students in SSC exams every year bears testimony to this fact.  Our first breakthrough
      was in the year 2006 SSC, wherein our students' secured State top ranks and
      since then the success saga continued every year. Our students scored top ten
      ranks continuously for several years. Our students continued to outperform others
      even after the introduction of the grading system.\n\nBecause of the strong
      foundation laid in our classrooms, our students have been successfully cracking
      various competitive exams like EAMCET, IIT-JEE, NEET etc. Not just in academics,
      our students excel in games, sports and fine arts on the national and international
      level competitions. It reveals the truth that the ultimate name for all-round

        text: "“Excellence through Education” Excellence means perfection. Doing a
          thing in a perfect manner gains the attention as well as the commendation
          of the world. Bright future awaits a person who attains perfection in his
          field, but perfection cannot be accomplished in a day or two. Constant practice
          is needed for it. As the proverb goes “Practice makes man perfect”, ample
          opportunities should be provided to the child for acquiring varied knowledge
          of things on his own. "

        title: Vision
        text: Such an atmosphere only makes the child learn the things by doing himself.
          It is this sort of self - learning that enables the child transform into
          an ablest person by reaching perfection or excellence. All the teaching
          and guidance and the facilities and activities provided in the school aim
          at imparting such an education as to make the child gain this excellence
          and become the most successful person in the world. Hence the motto “Excellence
          through Education” is adopted.

    title: Approach
    text: 'Our approach to imparting education recognises the importance of the principle
      that each child is unique when it comes to learning capacities and needs. That''s
      why we take utmost care in giving individualised attention and care to each
      child. Our teachers are continuously trained every year through summer workshops
      not only on the latest pedagogical methods but also on how to care for each
      child. We also believe that healthy and happy learning happens in stress-free
      environments. This we try to ensure through our spacious and green campuses
      which provide just the right kind of environment that nurtures the young minds
      where the adequate focus is also given to sports, games, arts and crafts learning,
      yoga, meditation etc. '
