        My school days in Keshava Reddy Public School are the most
        memorable and the best days ever! It not only provided me with the best
        education but also taught me great values to be a better person. It
        always strived to be “THE BEST” at everything, let it be the academics,
        faculty, non-teaching staff, facilities, extra-curricular activities etc. I
        firmly believe that our principal sir’s  ( Keshava Reddy Sir) zeal and
        desire to be always #1 brought out the best in every student and I am
        very proud to say that We are the #1 in the state now.
        We all know that teachers are the backbone of a successful school. The
        teachers here in Keshava Reddy Public School, without any doubt, lived
        up to the expectation. The teachers always encouraged us to develop a
        wholesome personality and played a crucial role in shaping my most

        Crucial years. They were so dedicated that even public holidays,
        festivals or Sundays never stopped them from teaching us J. They
        always gave timely and valuable input. The best of all, they gave us the
        best class notes, which were always a little more informative and the
        most useful when it comes to an understanding of the subject. They were always encouraging, helping and guiding us, providing intellectual as well as much needed emotional support. It helped me to reach for the extra mile and exceed expectations.

        So I take this as an opportunity to thank Keshava Reddy sir and all the
        faculty members of Keshava Reddy Public School, who always guided
        and supported me and provided a strong base for my future. Thanks to
        all.

        My school is truly a magnificent learning institution that stands head &amp; shoulders above the rest. It makes learning fun and produces students of the highest quality. Faculty is the best asset the school has got, the amount of effort they put in nurturing each student and the dedication, is priceless. The mere fact that all of my teachers still recognise me by name is enough to prove the care and attention they
        pay to an individual student. The strong foundation I had at the school has helped me a lot in my latter education. It made me stand out among others. The most important thing that my school taught me was ethics. I firmly believe that these qualities have to be inculcated in the school level of any child, my teachers have given more than what I could ask for, and I am indebted to them for life. It was here I learnt that the destination is not what that matters but the path you choose.

        The management of the school has always been the best, the amount of
        The dedication they have towards students is next to none. Mr Keshava Reddy Sir has always been a role model to me, the way he nurtured a small school to one of the best educational institutions, inspires students. It is from him I learnt that there is nothing that is impossible with hard work. Enormous efforts are put in developing the study material, and extreme care is taken so that students get the best that is available. The fact that all the material goes through several levels of review before they reach students proves the commitment the
        management has got towards the students.

        I can proudly announce that this is the best school which is so student-friendly and gave good value for student's feedback. We use to feel it like a family sitting together and judging out what is best and what is not for the family. So I would rather call it a family than a school.  Keshava Reddy School is at its best in individual attention and care. Each student was specially treated, and their performances were taken care of.

        Parents were always like invited guests at our school. They were always
        free to walk into any of the campuses and easily meet Teachers, Principal, Vice-Principal or class teachers etc. Parents were given very good respect and value. KR sir always gave attention to parent’s opinions and suggestions.

        that it has the best of the faculty available. Such a team of faculty was
        due to the constant and continuous efforts from Keshava Reddy Sir and his
        administrative staff. The school has helped me build good concepts, and this
        had laid a strong foundation for my education throughout. The focus was always
        on teaching concepts better and understandable to the students. The instructions
        were aimed at the level of the average student, and the pace of learning was
        perfectly right with little stress. The instructions were not just restricted
        to Academics but were meant to mould the character of the student. Discipline
        is essential to lead an organised life, and the school has always paid a lot
        of attention to it. My school has taught the spirit of Hard work in me which,
        I hope pays you off throughout your life. It is highly essential for a successful
        career. \n\nKeshava Reddy Sir used to have regular personal interaction with
        the student individually to discuss his problems apart from periodic meetings
        with the class in a whole. Hence attention was paid at an individual level
        on each student. The class notes that were provided was highly essential and
        goal-oriented and helped us hit the bull's eye. These class notes were prepared
        with attention to every detail with a lot of revisions from the entire faculty.
        Also, the school recognises the role of the parent in the education of their
        ward and hence has parent meetings regularly to update the student performance
        to parents and also help parents play their part in the success of their ward.
        The extracurricular activities and games in the school helped us to have a
        complete life. The school that I have studied in my view is the best and has
        left a lot of fond memories."
