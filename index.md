        text: "Keshava reddy schools have been a pioneer in giving the best quality
          education in both the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.  Right now
          there are 32 campuses spread across ten districts in both the Telugu states.
          We have the best in class infrastructure, which provides just the right
          environment for happy and healthy learning for the child. Our focus is also
          on exposing the child to sports, games, extra & co-curricular activities
          to bring out innate talents that make them all-rounders in life. \n \nStress-free
          education on our campuses ensures that learning becomes a joy rather than
          a burden for the child. Our continuously trained faculty makes sure that
          the students have a firm grounding in the fundamentals of various subjects.
          The best results being achieved by our students in SSC exams in both states
          every year bears testimony to our vision of becoming the best provider of
          quality stress-free education."
