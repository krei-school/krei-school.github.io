        text: "Keshava reddy schools have been a pioneer in giving the best quality
          education in both the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The schools
          have humble beginnings in Rayalaseema where the first school was started
          in Nandyal in 1993. Right now there are 32 branches spread across 10 districts
          in both the Telugu states. 12 of these are residential campuses with best
          in class infrastructure which provide just the right environment for happy
          and healthy learning for the child. Our focus is also on exposing the child
          to sports, games, extra & co-curricular activities to bring out innate talents
          that make them all-rounders in life. \n \nWe understand and strongly believe
          that each childâ€™s learning needs are unique. That's why through our unique
          Adoption program we ensure that each and every child is given individual
          attention and care. Stress-free education on our campuses ensures that learning
          becomes a joy rather than a burden for the child. Our continuously trained
          faculty makes sure that the students have a strong grounding in the basics
          and fundamentals of various subjects. The best results being achieved by
          our students in SSC exams in both states every year bears testimony to our
          vision of becoming the best provider of quality stress-free education.\n"
