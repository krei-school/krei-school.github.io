        text: "Keshava reddy schools have been a pioneer in giving the best quality
          education in both the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.  Right now
          there are 32 campuses spread across ten districts in both the Telugu states.
          We have the best in class infrastructure, which provides just the right
          environment for happy and healthy learning for the child. Our focus is also
          on exposing the child to sports, games, extra & co-curricular activities
          to bring out innate talents that make them all-rounders in life. \n \nStress-free
          education on our campuses ensures that learning becomes a joy rather than
          a burden for the child. Our continuously trained faculty makes sure that
          the students have a firm grounding in the fundamentals of various subjects.
          The best results being achieved by our students in SSC exams in both states
          every year bears testimony to our vision of becoming the best provider of
          quality stress-free education."

        and the best days ever! It not only provided me with the best\neducation but
        also taught me great values to be a better person. It\nalways strived to be
        “THE BEST” at everything, let it be the academics,\nfaculty, non-teaching
        staff, facilities, extra-curricular activities etc. \nWe all know that teachers
        are the backbone of a successful school. The\nteachers here in Keshava Reddy
        Public School, without any doubt, lived\nup to the expectation. The teachers
        always encouraged us to develop a\nwholesome personality and played a crucial
        role in shaping my most crucial years. They always gave timely and valuable
        input. They were always encouraging, helping and guiding us, providing intellectual
        as well as much needed emotional support. It helped me to reach for the extra
        mile and exceed expectations.\n"

    - text: My school is truly a magnificent learning institution that stands head
        &  shoulders above the rest. It makes learning fun and produces students of
        the highest quality. Faculty is the best asset the school has got, the amount
        of effort they put in nurturing each student and the dedication, is priceless.
        The mere fact that all of my teachers still recognise me by name is enough
        to prove the care and attention they pay to an individual student. The strong
        foundation I had at the school has helped me a lot in my latter education.
        It made me stand out among others. The most important thing that my school
        taught me was ethics. I firmly believe that these qualities have to be inculcated
        in the school level of any child, my teachers have given more than what I
        could ask for, and I am indebted to them for life. It was here I learnt that
        the destination is not what that matters but the path you choose.

        and gave good value for student''s feedback. We use to feel it like a family
        sitting together and judging out what is best and what is not for the family.
        So I would rather call it a family than a school.  Keshava Reddy School is
        at its best in individual attention and care. Each student was specially treated,
        and their performances were taken care of. Parents were always like invited
        guests at our school. They were always free to walk into any of the campuses
        and easily meet Teachers, Principal, Vice-Principal or class teachers etc.
        Parents were given very good respect and value. KR sir always gave attention
        to parent’s opinions and suggestions.

        the best of the faculty available. The school has helped me build good concepts,
        and this had laid a strong foundation for my education throughout. The instructions
        were aimed at the level of the average student, and the pace of learning was
        perfectly right with little stress. The instructions were not just restricted
        to Academics but were meant to mould the character of the student. Discipline
        is essential to lead an organised life, and the school has always paid a lot
        of attention to it. My school has taught the spirit of Hard work in me which,
        I hope pays you off throughout your life. It is highly essential for a successful
        career. Attention was paid at an individual level on each student. The extracurricular
        activities and games in the school helped us to have a complete life. The
        school that I have studied in my view is the best and has left a lot of fond
        memories.
