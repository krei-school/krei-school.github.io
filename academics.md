        title: THE Program
        text: "THE ( Telugu, Hindi, English) programme is designed to enhance the
          reading levels of the students in all the three languages. As a first step,
          the current level of reading skills of each student is evaluated by the
          subject experts. Depending on this assessment every day the particular student
          is made to read a particular selected paragraphs from the textbook in front
          of the parents at home and also explain the meaning of it to the parent
          and communicate the feedback to the subject teacher on a day to day basis.
          This activity is done continuously until there is a perceptible change in
          the reading levels of the students.  \n\nThus the parents are also made
          stakeholders in this programme and are expected to play an active role.
          The response from results in terms of improvements in reading levels of
          students across the three languages has been great."

    title: Calligraphy
    text: "How one presents the knowledge in the exam is equally important to the
      content one shows. Our calligraphy classes focus on improving the subtle nuances
      of handwriting and conceptual drawings of the children. We have been a pioneer
      in Andhra and Telangana in introducing these first of a kind calligraphy classes
      across our campuses. \n\nMany of our previous students have a deep sense of
      gratitude towards their alma-mater for moulding their handwriting so beautifully
      in their formative years and for securing that little extra edge in the competitive
      exams."

      system will improve’. We strongly believe in this. That's why every year we
      conduct mandatory summer training workshops for all the teachers on our campuses.
      \n\nThese workshops are done by outside educational experts who are well versed

      workshops also provide the opportunity for the faculty to stay up to date on
      the latest happenings in their subjects. Our dedicated, knowledgeable and well-trained
      faculty is indeed the strongest pillar of our institutions. "
